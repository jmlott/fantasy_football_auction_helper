===============================

Tool that calculates the best players under salary cap when given a CSV file with auction values and projected points

NOTE: This is not quite ready for primetime. I am currently working on cleaning up the code and optimizing it so it doesn't take 20+ hours to complete while maxing out all four of my CPU cores. I will also explain the format of the CSV and add a section at the top of the code for user configurable options.

TODO:
- Avoid bye week conflicts
- Format displayed results
- Clean up code
- Add user configurable variables section
- Document usage
